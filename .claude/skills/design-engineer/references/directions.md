# Design Directions

Six design personalities to choose from. Each direction informs every decision — color, spacing, typography, motion.

## 1. Precision & Density

**For:** Admin panels, developer tools, trading platforms
**Examples:** Linear, Raycast, Terminal apps

**Characteristics:**
- Tight spacing (4px base)
- High information density
- Monospace or technical fonts
- Cool, muted colors
- Borders-only depth
- Minimal animation

**Feel:** A command center. Everything visible, nothing wasted.

## 2. Warmth & Approachability

**For:** Collaborative tools, note-taking apps, team software
**Examples:** Notion, Coda, Figma

**Characteristics:**
- Generous spacing (8px base)
- Rounded corners (8-12px)
- Warm neutral tones
- Subtle shadows
- Friendly typography (humanist sans)
- Playful micro-interactions

**Feel:** A comfortable workspace. Inviting, not intimidating.

## 3. Sophistication & Trust

**Characteristics:**
- Balanced spacing
- Cool grays with accent color
- Layered shadows
- Professional typography

**Examples:** Datadog, Grafana, New Relic

**Characteristics:**
- High contrast
- Bold colors
- Strong typographic hierarchy
- Clear call-to-actions
- Decisive UI patterns
- Status-driven color

**Feel:** A control room. Important things stand out.

## 5. Utility & Function

**For:** Developer tools, infrastructure, code-related apps
**Examples:** GitHub, GitLab, VS Code

**Characteristics:**
- Muted, functional colors
- Hierarchy-driven layout
- System fonts
- Minimal decoration
- Dense but organized
- Keyboard-first interactions

**Feel:** A well-organized toolbox. Everything has its place.

## 6. Data & Analysis

**For:** Analytics, BI tools, reporting dashboards
**Examples:** Mixpanel, Amplitude, Tableau

**Characteristics:**
- Chart-optimized layouts
- Numbers-first typography

## Strategic Color Decisions

**Foundation choice:**
- **Warm** — Approachable (slight yellow/orange tint)
- **Cool** — Professional (blue-gray base)
- **Pure neutral** — Minimal (true grays)
- **Tinted** — Distinctive (your brand color in grays)

**Accent color:**
Pick ONE primary accent. Use it for:
- Primary actions
- Active states
- Important indicators

Additional colors only for semantic meaning (success, warning, error).

## Layout Decisions

Let content needs drive structure:
- **Dense grids** — For scanning many items
- **Generous spacing** — For focus on few items
- **Navigation complexity** — Match app depth

## Typography Decisions

- **System fonts** — Fast, native, invisible (utility-focused)
- **Geometric sans** — Modern, clean (tech products)
- **Humanist sans** — Warm, readable (collaborative tools)
- **Monospace** — Technical, precise (developer tools)

## Blending Directions

You can blend aspects of different directions deliberately:

"Precision & Density base with Warmth & Approachability's rounded corners"

But be intentional. Document why you're blending. Random mixing creates visual confusion.
