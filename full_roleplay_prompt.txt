STORY PREMISE:
Hagrid's prized three-winged horse, a rare magical creature he'd raised from birth, is found dead outside his hut. The night before, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had visited for tea and stayed until after dark. As suspicions mount and friendships are tested, Hagrid seeks the truth about his beloved companion's demise.

- 6:45 PM - Hagrid shows them his new three-winged horse in the paddock
- 7:30 PM - Hagrid goes inside to prepare more tea, leaving the trio outside
- 7:35 PM - Ron attempts to practice his charm work with his broken wand
- 7:40 PM - Harry suggests practicing near the horse to show off their skills
- 7:45 PM - Ron's broken wand malfunctions during a Stupefy spell, hitting the horse
- 7:46 PM - The horse collapses, Harry witnesses everything

- 8:30 PM - They leave Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Harry carrying their guilty secret
- 6:00 AM next day - Hagrid discovers his horse dead in the paddock

SOLUTION:
- Culprit: Ron Weasley
- Method: A miscast Stupefy spell from Ron's broken wand, which was much more powerful than intended due to the wand's damaged state, causing fatal damage to the horse's vital organs
- Motive: There was no malicious intent - Ron was practicing charms to improve his magical abilities and showing off to his friends, but his broken wand caused the spell to become lethal
