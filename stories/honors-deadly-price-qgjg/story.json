  "premise": "In a conservative small town, the brutal murder of 19-year-old Priya Sharma has shocked the community. Her body was found in an abandoned factory, bearing signs of extreme violence, with evidence suggesting the killer was someone who knew her well.",

  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Inspector Suresh Kumar",
    "method": "Inspector Kumar poisoned Priya's champagne during Vikram's speech, knowing she would drink alone after Arjun's departure. He used his position to manipulate the investigation afterward.",
    "motive": "After Priya rejected his advances and threatened to expose his harassment, Kumar decided to eliminate her before she could damage his reputation or reveal his misconduct.",
    "explanation": "Inspector Kumar orchestrated the perfect crime by using his daughter Maya as an unwitting alibi and exploiting local honor killing prejudices as a cover. He deliberately steered the investigation toward Rajesh Sharma, knowing the father's conservative views would make him an ideal suspect. The inspector's true motive was revealed through witness accounts of his rejected advances and Priya's documentation of local corruption, which she threatened to expose."
