  "difficulty": "hard",
  "estimatedMinutes": 50,
  "setting": {
    "location": "221B Baker Street, London",
    "timePeriod": "Victorian Era",
    "atmosphere": "melancholic and betrayed, thick with broken trust"
  },
  "premise": "The world's greatest detective lies dead in his own sanctuary at 221B Baker Street, poisoned by carbon monoxide at dawn. Dr. Watson, his most trusted friend, returns to find his companion murdered in a locked room - a revenge plot tied to their last failed case.",
  "actualEvents": [
    "3:15 PM - Inspector Lestrade visits Baker Street, acting unusually nervous when Mrs. Watson is mentioned",
    "4:30 PM - Thomas Crawford performs routine gas line inspection, notes everything is in working order",
    "5:45 PM - James Moriarty Jr. is seen watching the building from across the street by Mrs. Hudson",
    "6:30 PM - Watson visits Holmes, carrying his medical bag. Mrs. Hudson hears civil conversation",
    "7:00 PM - Watson leaves through front door, observed by Lestrade who was arriving to discuss a case",
    "7:15 PM - Holmes is heard moving about his room by Mrs. Hudson",

  ],
  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Dr. John Watson",
    "method": "Watson manipulated the chimney flue to redirect carbon monoxide back into Holmes' study while appearing to have left the premises. His medical knowledge allowed him to predict the exact effects and timing.",
    "motive": "Watson blamed Holmes for failing to protect his wife from a dangerous fugitive, despite Holmes' promise to keep her safe. The grief and betrayal transformed into a calculated desire for revenge.",
    "explanation": "Dr. Watson used his medical expertise and intimate knowledge of 221B Baker Street to orchestrate a seemingly accidental death. He created an alibi by leaving through the front door, but secretly returned to tamper with the chimney. His earlier visit with the medical bag allowed him to set up the conditions needed for the carbon monoxide poisoning, while his reputation as Holmes' trusted friend kept him above suspicion."
