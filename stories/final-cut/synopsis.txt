A famous Bollywood film producer, Raj Malhotra, is found dead in his office at Malhotra Studios during the wrap party of his latest blockbuster. The office was locked from inside.

Five people were present at the party and had access to his office that night:
1. His wife Priya - a former actress who gave up her career for him
2. His business partner Vikram - who has been secretly embezzling funds
3. The film's lead actress Meera - who Raj was rumored to be having an affair with
4. His personal assistant Arjun - who knows all of Raj's secrets
5. The director Kabir - whose previous three films with Raj all flopped

The murder weapon was a prestigious Filmfare Award trophy. Raj had threatened to expose a major secret that would ruin one of them forever.
