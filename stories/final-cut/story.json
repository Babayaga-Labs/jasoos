  "premise": "During the wrap party of his latest film, renowned producer Raj Malhotra is found dead in his office, which was locked from inside.

  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Kabir",
    "method": "Used the scaffold outside the window to re-enter after leaving through the door, making it appear locked from inside",
    "motive": "Raj discovered Kabir had been selling company scripts to rival studios",
    "explanation": "Kabir had been secretly selling Malhotra Studios' scripts to competing production houses, explaining why his last three films flopped - they were already leaked. When Raj discovered this betrayal, he threatened to expose Kabir, which would have ended his career and likely led to criminal charges. Kabir used his knowledge of the building's renovation scaffold to stage a locked-room murder, making it appear impossible for anyone to have entered or left."
