  "solution": {
    "culprit": "James Harrison",
    "method": "During a manic episode, Harrison used a castle kitchen knife to stab the Queen while she was vulnerable in her bath. In his panic, he hid the weapon in Edward's chambers, knowing the Prince was away at a secret meeting, hoping to deflect suspicion.",
    "motive": "Harrison's untreated bipolar disorder led to a severe manic episode, triggering a violent outburst against the person he saw as the ultimate symbol of the order and control he struggled to maintain in his own mind.",
    "explanation": "Harrison's mental state deteriorated that morning, noticed by kitchen staff. The opportunity presented itself when he delivered towels to the Queen's bath, and Dr. Gull's witness account places him fleeing the scene. His composed behavior afterward demonstrates the swing in his bipolar condition, while the weapon's location in Edward's room was an opportunistic attempt to frame the heir, possible only because Harrison knew of the Prince's secret meeting schedule."
