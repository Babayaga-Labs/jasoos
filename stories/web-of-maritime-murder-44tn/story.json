  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Peter Parker",
    "method": "During a bipolar episode, Peter Parker used his security clearance to enter May's suite. Using his enhanced strength as Spider-Man, he crushed her skull in a moment of psychosis, then methodically cleaned up and disposed of evidence using his intimate knowledge of ship security protocols.",
    "motive": "Peter's untreated bipolar disorder led to a severe psychotic break. The stress of maintaining his secret identity while managing ship security, combined with May's growing influence in real estate circles (which threatened to expose some of his vigilante activities), triggered a violent episode.",
    "explanation": "Peter Parker's position as Security Chief provided him perfect access and knowledge to commit the crime and cover his tracks. His documented anxiety episode earlier that day, followed by the suspicious gap in his security rounds, coincides with the murder timeframe. Multiple witnesses observed his erratic behavior throughout the day, and his unusual activities after the murder - including thorough hand-washing and suspicious disposal of evidence - point to his guilt. The method of death (crushed skull) matches his enhanced abilities, which he tried to disguise as a random act of violence."
