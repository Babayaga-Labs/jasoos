  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Krishna",
    "method": "During the food ordering distraction, Krishna pocketed the earphones while walking past the coffee table. He later used the dinner preparation time to hide them in his bedroom inside a hollowed-out book.",
    "motive": "Struggling financially and envious of others' possessions, Krishna stole the earphones out of resentment. His role as host and provider masked his growing bitterness about not owning premium items himself.",
    "explanation": "Krishna created multiple distractions throughout the evening to execute and cover up his theft. His unusual movement past the coffee table, noticed by Chopus, was the actual theft. The private conversation with Sujal about finances reveals his motive, while his attempt to deflect suspicion onto Siddy shows consciousness of guilt."
