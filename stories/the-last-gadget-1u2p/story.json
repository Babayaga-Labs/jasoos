  "victimParagraph": "Doraemon wasn't just a robotic cat - he was a beloved guardian from the future, sent to guide and protect Nobita Nobi. His magical fourth-dimensional pocket contained gadgets that helped countless children, but also attracted the attention of those who sought to exploit his technology. Despite his mechanical nature, Doraemon had developed real emotions and relationships, making his deactivation not just the loss of a machine, but the death of a friend who had changed many lives.",

  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Dekisugi Hidetoshi",
    "method": "Used a custom-built electromagnetic pulse device disguised as a science project, targeting Doraemon's core AI systems while appearing to seek help with homework. The device was designed to corrupt AI patterns specifically, making it appear like a natural malfunction.",
    "motive": "After multiple failed attempts to replicate Doraemon's advanced AI, Dekisugi became obsessed with studying the original. His jealousy and scientific ambition led him to plan Doraemon's deactivation, intending to extract and analyze the AI core afterward.",
    "explanation": "Dekisugi's recent focus on AI research, combined with his suspicious request for help and the timing of his exit, points to his guilt. The specialized nature of the damage to Doraemon's systems matches Dekisugi's expertise in electronics. His uncharacteristic interest in Doraemon, normally avoiding the robot due to pride, suggests premeditation. The crime's technical nature and timing aligns perfectly with his capabilities and opportunity window."
