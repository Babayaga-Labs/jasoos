  "victimParagraph": "Lucy Chen, a brilliant 16-year-old coding prodigy, was already following in her father's footsteps with several pending patents and a growing reputation in Silicon Valley. Despite her privileged upbringing, she was known for her charitable work teaching coding to underprivileged youth and had recently announced plans to launch a global education initiative. Her kidnapping occurred just weeks before she was set to unveil a revolutionary AI security system that could disrupt the entire tech industry.",

  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Grace Chen",
    "method": "Grace laced Lucy's soup with sedatives from her personal medication, knowing Lucy's dietary restrictions would ensure she was the only one who could deliver it. She used the spoon to trigger a manual override in Lucy's window (a vulnerability she learned about from eavesdropping on Dr. Winters), then arranged for Lucy's unconscious body to be removed through pre-arranged means while everyone was distracted by Petrov's announcement",
    "motive": "Grace felt threatened by Lucy's growing influence in the company and her close relationship with Lucy's father. The final straw was discovering Lucy planned to expose corruption, which would have implicated Grace's own embezzlement scheme",
    "explanation": "Grace Chen orchestrated a perfect storm of distractions while exploiting her trusted position as stepmother. She used her knowledge of the security system's vulnerability, Lucy's dietary restrictions, and the chaos of the gala to execute the kidnapping. The spilled soup, the security override, and the timing of Petrov's distraction were all carefully planned components of her scheme, while other suspects' suspicious behaviors were merely coincidental to their own secrets."
