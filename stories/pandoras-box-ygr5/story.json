  "title": "Pandora's Box",
  "difficulty": "hard",
  "estimatedMinutes": 35,
  "setting": {
    "location": "Amazon rainforest",
    "timePeriod": "Present day",
    "atmosphere": "Dense, oppressive jungle environment where ancient ruins loom in shadows. The constant drone of insects and distant animal calls creates an unsettling backdrop, while the suffocating humidity and limited visibility add to the sense of isolation and paranoia."
  },
  "premise": "Deep in the Amazon rainforest, four unlikely companions discover an ancient ruin they believe to be Pandora's Box. Their excitement turns to horror when they stumble upon the body of Neutehayu, a local tribal member, brutally murdered within the sacred space. With no communication to the outside world and a killer among them, they must solve the crime before another falls victim to the darkness that lurks within their group.",
  "actualEvents": [
    "Day 1, 8:00 AM - Group arrives at the ruins: Aryan Jain, Anvith Rajput, and Dora Black, guided by Neutehayu",
    "Day 1, 11:30 AM - Neutehayu shows them ancient markings suggesting the location of Pandora's Box",
    "Day 1, 2:00 PM - Group splits up to explore different sections; Aryan experiences a personality shift",
    "Day 1, 3:15 PM - Aryan, in his alternate personality, follows Neutehayu to a secluded chamber",
    "Day 1, 3:30 PM - Aryan attacks Neutehayu with his nail cutter when the tribal member is examining wall carvings",
    "Day 1, 4:45 PM - Aryan returns to normal personality with no memory of the attack",
    "Day 1, 5:30 PM - Dora Black discovers Neutehayu's body while searching for him",
    "Day 1, 5:45 PM - Group reconvenes at the crime scene, all showing genuine shock and horror"
  ],
  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Aryan Jain",
    "method": "During a dissociative episode, Aryan used his personal nail cutter to repeatedly stab Neutehayu in the neck while the victim was distracted examining ancient wall carvings. The unusual angle and depth of wounds match the unique shape of his nail cutter's blade.",
    "motive": "Aryan suffers from undiagnosed Dissociative Identity Disorder. His alternate personality committed the murder without any rational motive, leaving his primary personality with no memory of the event.",
    "explanation": "Aryan Jain's recent lottery win enabled him to join this expedition, but his untreated mental condition proved deadly. While exploring the ruins, he experienced a dissociative episode triggered by the stress and mystique of the location. His alternate personality attacked Neutehayu with his nail cutter, creating distinct wound patterns that could only match his personal grooming tool. Upon returning to his primary personality, Aryan had no recollection of the crime, explaining his genuine shock at the discovery and making him appear innocent to others."
