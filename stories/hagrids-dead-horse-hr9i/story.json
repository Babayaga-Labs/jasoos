  "solution": {
    "culprit": "Ron Weasley",
    "method": "A miscast Stupefy spell from Ron's broken wand, which was much more powerful than intended due to the wand's damaged state, causing fatal damage to the horse's vital organs",
    "motive": "There was no malicious intent - Ron was practicing charms to improve his magical abilities and showing off to his friends, but his broken wand caused the spell to become lethal",
    "explanation": "Ron Weasley, struggling with his broken wand, was practicing spells near Hagrid's paddock while Harry watched. Attempting to cast a simple Stupefy spell, his damaged wand caused the spell to become fatally powerful, instantly killing the three-winged horse. Frightened of the consequences and Hagrid's reaction, Ron swore Harry to secrecy and pretended nothing had happened. The truth was buried beneath layers of guilt and friendship, until the investigation revealed the tragic accident."
