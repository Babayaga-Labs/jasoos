    "culprit": "khyati meena",
    "method": "dharam meena's gun",
    "motive": "she liked the captain and tried to advance on him, when he refused and threthened to tell her husband she shot him with her husband's gun",
    "explanation": "Khyati Meena murdered Captain Weber using her husband's gun after he rejected her advances and threatened to expose her behavior to Dharam. She had access to the weapon through knowing her husband's safe combination, and the expertise to use it from her action movie career. Her false alibi was contradicted by multiple witnesses who saw her near the crime scene, and the captain's distressed state before his death corroborates the confrontation that led to his murder."
