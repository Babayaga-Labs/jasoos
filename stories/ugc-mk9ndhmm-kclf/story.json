    "explanation": "James Miller had been secretly gambling away Sarah's college fund and taking loans from dangerous people. Sarah discovered this while snooping through his office and confronted him during her birthday party. When she threatened to tell her mother (his ex-wife), who was already seeking increased custody, he panicked. He lured her to the woods under the pretense of a father-daughter talk and killed her to keep his secret."
